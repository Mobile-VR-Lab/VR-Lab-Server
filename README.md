# VR Lab Server

This server's purpose is to balance the load of several dozen connections and to provide a friendly
API for the instructor app to interact with. This server takes some load off the instructor app,
so that both components can run on cheap or used hardware. This way, most of the money can be spent
on the nice VR headsets which do most of the heavy lifting.

See the GitLab wiki pages for more information.
